MusicConcierge
==============

This little project is beta on Heroku now. Play and help me to test the app. 
http://music-concierge.herokuapp.com/#/

Sep 30th, 2014 - Added Word Game
Oct 1st, 2014 - Added dist to GitHub and deployed the app to Heroku

Music Concierge - Start with Fav Album list with adding and removing, drag-and-drop sortable; Record persists in your local browser's cookie. You records would be still there after you refresh. Open-Ended development around things about music.

Technologies - Angular app; Bootstrap; Yeoman; Bower; Grunt; Karma test framework (May try Protractor later)

Using Yeoman Angular Generator to scaffold the stack, Bower for dependencies and package management; Grunt as task running for this Angular app; Basic Karma unit tests to adapt TDD...

Will continue building little bit by little bit...

To-Do -
- Better User Name approach in App (no more hard coded "Beni Cheni's...")
- Also a bug with enter with a blank album name.
- Another bug when the Answer button has to be clicked by the mouse but no response for Enter key. 
- An un-finished feature when incorrect answer is given to the Word Game.
- Need a scrollable grid, or even pagination, for album list.
- Enhancement to make Correct/Incorrect animations.
- Consume open API out there to get data with volume to play with.
- Try D3.js to do data visualization .
- Think more other ideas to practice.

Thanks for viewing. Please contribute if you'd like to practice coding Front-End modern technologies.
