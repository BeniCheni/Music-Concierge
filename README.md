Will continue building little bit by little bit...

<h5>To-Do:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>A bug with enter with a blank album name.  Need better handling.</li>
    <li>Another bug when the Answer button has to be clicked by the mouse but no response for Enter key.</li> 
    <li>An un-finished feature when incorrect answer is given to the Word Game.</li>
    <li>Need a scrollable grid, or even pagination, for album list.</li>
    <li>Enhancement to make Correct/Incorrect animations.</li>
    <li>Try D3.js to do data visualization.</li>
    <li>Think more other ideas to practice with Last.fm data.</li>
</ul>
Thanks for viewing. Please contribute if you'd like to practice coding Front-End modern technologies.
