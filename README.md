Go Down the Drain
==============
<h2>(while the repo name is Music-Concierge)</h2>
This little project is beta on Heroku now. Please play and help me to test the app. :-)

Attempting to bridge technology and art making this weekend. Will add border and main city names, maybe a word game too. Play and help me test, please...

<strong>Music Concierge - Top Albums Search Engine using Last.fm (a music site) API and a word game based on the search results. Not very good yet. But it's there.</strong> -

<strong>To-Do:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>A bug with enter with a blank album name.  Need better handling.</li>
    <li>Another bug when the Answer button has to be clicked by the mouse but no response for Enter key.</li> 
    <li>An un-finished feature when incorrect answer is given to the Word Game.</li>
    <li>Need a scrollable grid, or even pagination, for album list.</li>
    <li>Enhancement to make Correct/Incorrect animations.</li>
    <li>Try D3.js to do data visualization.</li>
    <li>Think more other ideas to practice with Last.fm data.</li>
</ul>
Thanks for viewing. Please contribute if you'd like to practice coding Front-End modern technologies.
