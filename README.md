MusicConcierge
==============

This little project is beta on Heroku now. Play and help me to test the app. 
http://music-concierge.herokuapp.com/#/

Sep 30th, 2014 - Added Word Game
Oct 1st, 2014 - Added dist to GitHub and deployed the app to Heroku
Oct 2nd, 2014 - Redesigned with Last.fm API

Music Concierge -
- Start with Top Album list from Last.fm API, results as drag-and-drop sortable.
- A Word Game guessing shuffled words based on users' album results.

Open-Ended development around things about music, or even beyond. Really an open space to practice modern front-end technologies now.

Data - Last.fm API
Technologies - Angular app; Bootstrap; Yeoman; Bower; Grunt; Karma test framework (May try Protractor later); HTML5; CSS3

Using Yeoman Angular Generator to scaffold the stack, Bower for dependencies and package management; Grunt as task runner for this Angular app; Basic Karma unit tests to adapt TDD...

Will continue building little bit by little bit...

To-Do -
- A bug with enter with a blank album name.  Need better handling.
- Another bug when the Answer button has to be clicked by the mouse but no response for Enter key. 
- An un-finished feature when incorrect answer is given to the Word Game.
- Need a scrollable grid, or even pagination, for album list.
- Enhancement to make Correct/Incorrect animations.
- Try D3.js to do data visualization.
- Think more other ideas to practice with Last.fm data.

Thanks for viewing. Please contribute if you'd like to practice coding Front-End modern technologies.
